# DeBlur

## Problem

Whether you're looking at a damaged document or taking a picture of the whiteboard during class in a hurry, image text can sometimes be blurry or generally hard to read. Our goal is to leverage AI to improve the readability of unclear text.

## Solution

Our application takes in text from an image (via image upload or snapshot), processes it through an AI algorithm, and outputs a "deblurred" version of the image to improve readability.
